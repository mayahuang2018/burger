# burger

## Overview

This is a burger logger with **MySQL**, **Node**, **Express**, **Handlebars** and a homemade **ORM**(!). 

It is my **Node Express Handlebars** Assignment in Gatech Coding bootcamp. I followed the MVC design pattern offered by Coding Bootcamp, and designed the wedpage on my own.

## About "Eat-Da-burger!"

* According to homework instructions, Eat-Da-Burger! is a "restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat".

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the name on the left side of the page, with a `Devour it!` button.

* When the user clicks `Devour it!`, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database.
